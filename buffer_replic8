Additional information
	

    Requested size 524288 bytes, implemented size 4194304 bytes, stall-free, 8 reads and 1 write. 
    For each bank, 8 replicates were created to efficiently support multiple accesses. To reduce this factor, reduce number of read and write accesses.
    Private memory implemented in on-chip block RAM.
